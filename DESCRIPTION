Title: Diagnostics for assessing genomic DNA contamination in RNA-seq data
Version: 1.1.4

Description: Provides diagnostics for assessing genomic DNA contamination in
    RNA-seq data, as well as plots representing these diagnostics. Moreover, the package can be used to get an insight into the strand library protocol used and, in case of strand-specific libraries, the strandedness of the data. Furthermore, it provides functionality to filter out reads of potential gDNA origin.
